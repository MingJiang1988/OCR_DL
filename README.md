# text-detection-ctpn

text detection mainly based on ctpn (connectionist text proposal network). It is implemented in tensorflow. I use id card detect as an example to demonstrate the results, but it should be noticing that this model can be used in almost every horizontal scene text detection task. The origin paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03605). Also, the origin repo in caffe can be found in [here](https://github.com/tianzhi0549/CTPN). For more detail about the paper and code, see this [blog](http://slade-ruan.me/2017/10/22/text-detection-ctpn/)
